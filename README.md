# deep_radiotranscriptomics_survival_analysis

The proposed methodology is a survival analysis for non-small cell lung cancer patients. Two classifiers are examined, Survival Support Vector Machine and Random Survival Forest. The classifiers take as input: 
<ul>
  <li>a) radiomics, transcriptomics, and deep features</li> 
  <li>b) radiomics and deep features </li>
 </ul>
 
 to predict the class of the patients, if they are low-risk or high-risk patients. 


<b>Requirements:</b> 
<ul>
To run the scripts, you will need: 
<ul>
 <li>Python</li> 
 <li>scikit-survival (open source)</li> 
</ul>
</ul>
